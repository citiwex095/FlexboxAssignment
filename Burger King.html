      <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-1">Burger King is the latest fast-food chain to establish a rewards program aimed at expanding its customer base and enticing existing patrons to be more loyal. It joins a growing number of restaurants embracing digital payments and rewards incentives during the pandemic.</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-2">Beginning this week, Burger King is rolling out its new Royal Perks program in five areas of the US, including Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey, New York City and Long Island, New York. It works a lot like its competitors' plans: Every $1 spent earns 10 "crowns" that participating customers can use to redeem free food or upgrade orders. Availability of the rewards program will expand throughout the year.</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-3">Burger King said in a statement that Royal Perks is "one more step on our digital journey" that has recently included adding online and delivery orders and digital coupons. The chain, owned by Restaurant Brands International, is in the midst of a modernization phase, which includes revamped restaurants and high-tech drive-thrus.</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-3">Ultimately, the goal for Burger King and other brands with loyalty programs is to increase sales and lure in customers, ideally on a daily basis, by giving them reasons to choose them over their competitors. The programs also give restaurant owners access to customers' data and ordering habits that help target diners with customized deals.</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-4">Many large chains have seen a substantial increase in rewards members and digital orders during the past year, brought on by the pandemic and changing customer habits. Here's how they're benefiting.</div>
